### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github profile! I am an astrophysics PhD student, at the University of Hertfordshire. Currently in my final year, so lots of writing ahead.
Here, on Github, you can find the code that was introduced in my first published paper (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A%26A...637A..62S/abstract). The repository also features a Binderhub launch button, so that you can fire up a complete jupyter environment online, so as to test the code base.

As a brief introduction into my work, I utilise data taken from the Very Large Telescope (VLT), using the MUSE spectroscopic instrument; photometric data is normally 2 spatial coordinates (RA and DEC, or x and y), along with a flux intensity at each pixel, Integral Field Unit (IFUs) spectroscopy has 3 dimensions: again, 2 spatial, accompanied by a spectral range for each pixel. The data itself is commonly refered to as a datacube, and contains a wealth of multi-wavelength information about the observed object.
Using this data, I search for the specific emisison of [OIII], originating from Planetary Nebulae, which themselves are located in extra-galactic targets.

Another of my repositories houses the code for my github hosted static website. Painstakingly written via the github document editor, and tested on multiple browsers. The HTML and scss therein, was all written on the fly as I learned about the different aspects of a website. The entire was self taught and self driven. It is however abismally out of date. Oops.

If you would like to get in touch, or ask a question, you can reach me by mail (found in my github profile), as well as on twitter: @Tspriggs.
